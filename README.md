# Python Automation : Phone Number and Email Address Extractor from clipboard
> Say you have the boring task of finding every phone number and email
address in a long web page or document. If you manually scroll through
the page, you might end up searching for a long time. But if you had a program that 
could search the text in your clipboard for phone numbers and
email addresses, you could simply press ctrl-A to select all the text, press
ctrl-C to copy it to the clipboard, and then run your program.

## TODO
1. Get the text off the clipboard.
2. Find all phone numbers and email addresses in the text.
3. Paste them onto the clipboard

## Steps
 - Step 1: Create a Regex for Phone Numbers
 - Step 2: Create a Regex for Email Addresses
 - Step 3: Find All Matches in the Clipboard Text
 - Step 4: Join the Matches into a String for the Clipboard
